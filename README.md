For this issue, I've used MiniTests to avoid any dependency and to rely on the Ruby library only.

I kept the implementation simple as possible, if you have any remarks about the code or its structure
I would love to hear the feedback.

In order to execute tests run the following command:

```
ruby test/test_rover_problem.rb
```
